# Project Idea & Aim
In pharmacies there is a lot of repetitive consultation for minor illnesses happening. Together with the increased level of expected education of pharmacists this leads to either lower quality of consultation due to shorter available time or less pharmacies in the country. 

We would like to overcome this issue by implementing a workflow system which is capable of handling minor, uncritical issues fully automated on a chatbot-like screen in the pharmacy by following the standard process of a Pharmarcy. In our case, we will soley focus on automizing the consultation of flu-related issues, due to the following facts:
- the issue occures often enough that it could be viable
- no class A medications are involved (which require a prescription and in-person consultation with name and address) 
- customer-desires can be included (Homeopathia, Spagyric sprays etc.)
- there is a clear list for 'red flags' available, which require consultation (this can be included as a possible task)
- it is a typical process flow, which could later be amended with other applicaitons
- minimizing contact helps the spread of the flu, we therefore expect high-acceptance rates

# Process


## Process Description
The reader should imagine that there is a quiet corner in the pharmacy, where they can do the automated consultation in a touch screen.

The process is split in 2 sections:

1. Questionaire to find the symptoms and which rules out any 'red flag patients' who need consultation by a doctor.
2. Based on the information from section 1, there are three possible outcomes

    a. No consultation is necessary, the customer can select his preferences for the type of medication and he gets suggestions for medications. He can directly pay at the self-service machine and gets the medication delivered there too. E.g. directly from the robotized storage like here: https://rowa.de/de/loesungen/lagern-kommissionieren/bd-rowa-vmax/ 
    
    b. Consultation by the pharmacist is needed. The data entry from the chatbot gets transfered to a screen visible to the consulting pharmacist. The costomer receives a paper ticket with a number for the express consultation counter for people who use the self-service screen. (=incentive to use the self-service machine)
    
    c. A medical consultation is necessary at a doctor. The data entry from the chatbot gets transfered to a screen visible to the consulting pharmacist. The costomer receives a paper ticket with a number for the express consultation counter for people who use the self-service screen. (Same as b., the only difference is the consultation after)
